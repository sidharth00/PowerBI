Question 1 : Define Power BI and What are the key components of the Power BI ecosystem? Briefly explain: ● Power BI Desktop ● Power BI Service ● Power BI Mobile ● Power BI Gateway

Power BI is a Microsoft-developed interactive data visualization and business intelligence (BI) software product. It is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn disparate sources of raw data into cohesive, visually immersive, and interactive insights and reports.



The Power BI ecosystem comprises several tightly integrated components that facilitate the entire BI workflow, from data connection to consumption.



Key Components of the Power BI Ecosystem

The main components you'll interact with are:
Power BI Desktop: A free, Windows-based desktop application used primarily for authoring and creating reports. This is where users connect to various data sources, transform and clean the data using Power Query, model the data (create relationships and calculations using DAX), and design interactive reports and visualizations. Reports created here are typically saved as a .pbix file.



Power BI Service: A cloud-based Software as a Service (SaaS) platform (also known as PowerBI.com). Once reports are created in Power BI Desktop, they are published to the Power BI Service. This platform is the central hub for sharing, collaboration, and consumption. Users can view, interact with, and share reports and dashboards via a web browser, set up scheduled data refreshes, and create dashboards (a single-page collection of tiles/visuals from one or more reports).





Power BI Mobile: Native apps for iOS, Android, and Windows devices. Their main purpose is to allow users to consume and interact with reports and dashboards that have been published to the Power BI Service, enabling access to business intelligence data on the go. They often include features like alerts and push notifications for data changes.




Power BI Gateway: Software that acts as a secure bridge, providing fast and secure data transfer between the Power BI Service (in the cloud) and on-premises data sources (like SQL databases or local file shares) that are not directly accessible from the cloud. The Gateway is essential for enabling scheduled data refresh of reports connected to on-premises data.
